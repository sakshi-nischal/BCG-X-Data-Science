Subject: Data Requirement and Strategies to Mitigate Customer Churn

Hello Associate Director,

Hope you are having a good week. I and Estelle collaborated to discuss the key reason behind the customer churn. As per our discussion, we were able to figure out below reasons behind customer churn.

Key Reasons for Customer Churn:
Factors include price, clean energy, customer service, location, usage trends, customer satisfaction, marketing effectiveness, and system quality.

Data Requirements:
We need historical purchasing trends, geographical data, pricing data, usage patterns, customer service metrics, growth metrics, marketing data, and system performance metrics.

Data Analysis and Visualization:
We'll plot price trends against churn, map geographical hotspots, analyze usage patterns, correlate customer service ratings with churn, assess marketing impact, and compare system reliability with satisfaction.

By applying these strategies, we can understand churn causes and develop mitigation plans.

Looking forward to discussing further.

Regards,

Sakshi Nischal
